## PROPOSAL
Please see attached PDF for our Official Proposal.

## Description
For our final project, we will be creating a multiplayer Mafia game in the terminal. Up to 12 people can play, but once a game has started, no new players may join. At the start, roles (mafia, doctor, police, etc.) will be distributed randomly, and all other players will remain citizens. The number of mafias will be determined by how many players there are. At the beginning of each round called the “night” phase, the mafia will decide who to kill, the doctor will decide who to heal, and the police can find out one player’s role (might be more roles)... After that, dead players will only be able to view the game, not participate. After that phase of the game, there will be a minute for a debate of who people think is part of the mafia. Then, each player votes for a player that they think are the mafia for a minute. If any person gets the majority of the votes, the voting goes further: There will be a minute for players to vote (or abstain) if they think the person should be executed. If that player gets a majority of yeses, then he shall be executed. Its role will not be displayed. The game ends when either all mafia die or mafia outnumber the citizens.
